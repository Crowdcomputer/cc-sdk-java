cc-sdk-java
===========

The java sdk for the crowdcomputer APIs.
See more on www.crowdcomputer.org

Python version (which does much more) is [here](https://github.com/esseti/cc-sdk-python).


##What it does (or should do)
- APIs wrapper, so you can call methods (ideally with HasMap Parameters) and get back a JSON response without the need of doing the boring calls.
- Do the Authorization, with APP-TOKEN and USER-TOKEN.
- It will make the world better, belive me.
